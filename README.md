# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to provide incoming bootcamp students with the tools and knowledge needed for the prework portion of the course. In doing so, I learned some basic functions of HTML, JavaScript, and Git.

The study guide webpage contains four sections, each containing essential info for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, respectively, and in the DevTools console, JavaScript is visible running.
