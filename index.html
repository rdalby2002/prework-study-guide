        <ul>
          <li>The head element (AKA tag) contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to determine the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Info stored in the head is known as "metadata," which is a set of elements invisible to users that acts as the base for the content included in the body.</li>
          <li>The body denotes a webpage's visible content, such as text, images, and hyperlinks.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >).</li>
          <li>The child elements of the body are "semantic," meaning the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li> When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
