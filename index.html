        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element (AKA tag) contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to determine the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Info stored in the head is known as "metadata," which is a set of elements invisible to users that acts as the base for the content included in the body.</li>
          <li>The body denotes a webpage's visible content, such as text, images, and hyperlinks.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >).</li>
          <li>The child elements of the body are "semantic," meaning the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE html declaration informs the browser of the document type.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). </li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document. </li>
          <li>The most commonly used charset is UTF-8, which allows nearly all characters to be used and displayed in a webpage.</li>

            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>A link element must be established in the header of your HTML code to apply an external style sheet to your webpage.</li>
            <li>CSS rules consist of a selector and a set of declarations.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property </li>
            <li>A selector can be applied to all elements within a certain class of your webpage by placing a period before your selector.</li>
            <li>The border property assigns a border around your element.</li>
            <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
            <li>The width property attributes the percentage of available width that your element will occupy.</li>
            <li>When we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
            <li>Two selectors cam be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
            <li>The positioning property text-align can be used to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
            <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
            <li>To make each image on a webpage start on a new line, assign the block value to its disply property.</li>

            <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
            <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value using =</li>
            <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name.</li>
            <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code.</li>
